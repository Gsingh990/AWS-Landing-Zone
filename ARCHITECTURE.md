### AWS Control Tower Landing Zone Architecture Overview

This architecture describes an enterprise-scale AWS multi-account environment built upon AWS Control Tower, with Terraform managing and extending its capabilities. It adheres to AWS best practices for security, governance, and operational efficiency.

**Core Principles:**

*   **Centralized Governance:** Leveraging AWS Control Tower and AWS Organizations for policy enforcement and account management.
*   **Automated Account Provisioning:** Utilizing Control Tower's Account Factory for standardized account creation.
*   **Network Hub-and-Spoke:** Implementing a scalable and secure network topology with AWS Transit Gateway.
*   **Centralized Identity:** Integrating with AWS IAM Identity Center for streamlined access management.
*   **Foundational Security:** Deploying core security services across the organization.
*   **Infrastructure as Code:** Managing all deployable components with Terraform for consistency and repeatability.

#### **1. AWS Control Tower Foundation**

AWS Control Tower serves as the primary orchestrator, establishing a well-architected multi-account baseline. Terraform extends this foundation by managing resources *within* the accounts provisioned by Control Tower and by defining additional organizational structures.

*   **Management Account:** The central account where AWS Control Tower is deployed and managed. Terraform operations for the landing zone are typically initiated from here.
*   **Core Accounts (Managed by Control Tower):**
    *   **Log Archive Account:** Centralized repository for all AWS CloudTrail logs and AWS Config recordings from all accounts in the organization.
    *   **Audit Account:** Dedicated for security and compliance teams, providing restricted access to logs and security services for auditing purposes.

#### **2. Organizational Units (OUs) and Account Structure**

AWS Organizations provides the hierarchical structure for grouping accounts, enabling the application of Service Control Policies (SCPs) for preventive guardrails.

*   **Root OU:** The top-level OU in your AWS Organization.
*   **Core OUs (Managed by Terraform):**
    *   **Security OU:** Houses security-related accounts (e.g., Log Archive, Audit).
    *   **Infrastructure OU:** Contains accounts for shared infrastructure services (e.g., Shared Services VPC, centralized tools).
    *   **Workloads OU:** Designed for application and development accounts, allowing for logical separation of different business units or projects.
    *   **Sandbox OU:** Provides isolated environments for experimentation and learning.
*   **Control Tower Account Factory (Managed by Terraform):**
    *   Terraform interfaces with the Control Tower Account Factory to programmatically provision new AWS accounts. These accounts are automatically enrolled into Control Tower's governance baseline and placed into the specified OUs.
    *   Each new account is created with an initial IAM Identity Center (SSO) user for administrative access.

#### **3. Centralized Networking (Hub-and-Spoke)**

A robust network architecture is crucial for connectivity and security across the multi-account environment.

*   **AWS Transit Gateway (TGW):**
    *   Deployed in a central account (e.g., Shared Services or Network Account) to act as a network hub.
    *   Enables simplified routing and connectivity between multiple VPCs (spokes) and on-premises networks.
*   **Hub VPC:**
    *   A dedicated VPC (e.g., in the Shared Services account) connected to the Transit Gateway.
    *   Hosts shared network services like firewalls, DNS resolvers, and network monitoring tools.
    *   Contains subnets for various network functions (e.g., TGW attachments, shared services).
*   **Spoke VPCs (Conceptual):**
    *   Workload accounts will deploy their own VPCs (spokes) that peer with the Transit Gateway, allowing them to communicate with each other and with the Hub VPC.
*   **Optional Connectivity:**
    *   **Direct Connect (DX):**
        *   Provides a dedicated, private network connection from your on-premises data center to AWS.
        *   A Direct Connect Gateway and Transit Virtual Interface are configured to connect to the Transit Gateway, extending your on-premises network into your AWS cloud.
    *   **Site-to-Site VPN:**
        *   Establishes a secure IPsec tunnel connection between your on-premises network and your AWS VPC (via a VPN Gateway attached to the Hub VPC and Transit Gateway).
        *   Provides a resilient and encrypted connection for hybrid cloud scenarios.

---

#### **4. Identity & Access Management (IAM Identity Center)**

AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO) provides centralized access management for all accounts in the organization.

*   **Permission Sets:** Define granular permissions (e.g., `AdministratorAccess`) that can be assigned to users and groups.
*   **Account Assignments:** Users and groups from IAM Identity Center are assigned to specific AWS accounts with defined permission sets, granting them federated access.

---

#### **5. Security Baseline**

Foundational security services are deployed across the accounts to enhance the overall security posture.

*   **Amazon GuardDuty:**
    *   Intelligent threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS accounts and workloads.
*   **AWS Security Hub:**
    *   Provides a comprehensive view of your security state within AWS and helps you check your environment against security industry standards and best practices.
*   **AWS Config:**
    *   Enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources.
*   **AWS CloudTrail:**
    *   Records API calls and related events made in your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket.
*   **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall):**
    *   Helps protect your web applications or APIs against common web exploits and bots that may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.
*   **AWS Secrets Manager:**
    *   Helps you protect access to your applications, services, and IT resources by enabling you to easily rotate, manage, and retrieve database credentials, API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycle.
*   **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM):**
    *   Manages the creation, storage, and renewal of SSL/TLS X.509 certificates for your AWS services.
